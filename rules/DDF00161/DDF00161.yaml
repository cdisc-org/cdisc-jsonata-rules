Description: 'The ordering of activities (using the previous and next
  attributes) must include the parents (e.g. activities referring to children)
  preceding their children.'
Executability: Fully Executable
Outcome:
  Message: "The previous/next ordering of the activity with respect to child
    activities is incorrect - the activity has children but its nextId is not
    one if its childIds, the activity is a child but its previousId is not its
    parent or another child, and/or the activity's previousId refers to an
    activity with children but the activity is not one of those children."
