Description: 'If a biomedical concept is referenced from an activity then it is
  not expected to be referenced as well by a biomedical concept category that is
  referenced from the same activity.'
Executability: Partially Executable - Possible Overreporting
Outcome:
  Message: 'The activity references both a biomedical concept category and a
    biomedical concept, but the biomedical concept is a member of the referenced
    category or one of its subcategories.'
  Output Variables:
    - StudyDesign.id
    - StudyDesign.name
    - id
    - name
    - biomedicalConceptId
