Description: 'Epoch ordering using previous and next attributes is expected to
  be consistent with the order of corresponding scheduled activity instances
  according to their specified default conditions.'
Executability: Partially Executable - Possible Overreporting
Outcome:
  Message: 'The order of the epochs in the study design (as defined by the next
    attribute) does not match the order of epochs as referenced from scheduled
    activity instances in the main timeline that are ordered by default
    condition.'
  Output Variables:
    - name
    - ScheduleTimeline.id
    - ScheduleTimeline.name
    - ScheduleTimeline.mainTimeline
    - Epoch order by previous/next
    - Epoch order by timeline refs
